# Image Installer For IBM-VPC

vpc-img-inst is a CLI tool that automates generation of custom VSI images by installing _features_ (software bundles) on base images


## Setup

Mostly tested with Fedora 35 and Ubuntu 20, but should work with most Linux and Mac systems.   
#### Requirements
- `ssh-keygen` utility - available as part of the Open SSH client.
- Python3.

#### Installation
- `pip install vpc-img-inst`  
Following installation, a directory containing various scripts will be created in  `~/.vpc-img-inst`.   
Note - the directory will not be created or overwritten if it already exists. 

## Usage
- Create a new custom image:
```
vpc-img-inst [--iam-api-key IAM_API_KEY] [--region REGION] [-o OUTPUT_FOLDER] [-f FEATURE] [-im BASE_IMAGE_NAME] [-it INSTALLATION_TYPE] [--compute-iam-endpoint IAM_ENDPOINT] [-y] 
[--cleanup PATH_TO_RESOURCES_FILE][--version] [--help]
```
```vpc-img-inst --help```
### Examples
- `vpc-img-inst -a <API_KEY> -y -f cuda -it rhel -im ibm-redhat-8-6`  
Create a custom image of CUDA on RHEL 8.6
- `vpc-img-inst -a <API_KEY> -y -f docker -f cuda -it ubuntu` (using default base image)  
Create a custom image of Docker and CUDA on Ubuntu (default 20.4) 
- `vpc-img-inst --help`  
Get a short description of the available flags via  
- `vpc-img-inst -c <PATH_TO_FILE>`  
Clean-up a previously failed execution (see [Cleanup](##-Clean-up))

### Flags Detailed Description
Note - Flag values are case sensitive.  
For example `--feature cuda` !=  `--feature CUDA`.

## Extendability
To extend the features/installation types this program support, please follow the next steps:
1. To add a new feature, inside `~/.vpc-img-inst`, create a folder named after the feature in camel case format, e.g nodeJS.
2. to add new installation type, inside a feature's folder add a new installation type by adding a script with the following naming format: `install_<FeatureName>_<installation_type>.sh`, e.g. "install_cuda_ubuntu.sh".


## Clean-up
All resources created during the execution of the program will be automatically removed and unregistered from the IBM-VPC (apart from the created image). This process also takes place upon a failed run. 
#### Manual clean-up
To manually remove byproduct resources run: `vpc-img-inst -c <path_to_resources_file>`.  
Users may have to resort to running this command in the odd occasion where this program fails to remove its byproducts.   
The path to the resources file is printed at the start of the execution.
